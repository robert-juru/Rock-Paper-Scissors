## Description
This is a simple web-based game of rock paper scissors, created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The game has two pages: a starting page where the player can enter their name and a main game page where the actual game is played. The player can choose their move by clicking on one of the buttons representing rock, paper, or scissors. The computer's move is generated randomly. The result of each round is displayed on the screen, along with the updated score. The game ends when one player reaches a pre-defined number of points, and the final result is displayed.
